# 254Project_StudyHelper

This project is designed to help a user study through multiple different techniques. The program will alert the user when a camera detects that the user is distracted from their study matierials. It will then activate a buzzer to signal to the user to get back to work. It also features a timer that will track certain studying milestones and then the program will communicate to the user by signaling to an arduino to blink an LED So that the user can put the computer in a seperate location but will be still able to tell when the session is over or a milestone has been hit. It will also use OpenAI's API to send motivational messages that will be given to the user over voice.

Required Hardware: computer with python, webcam, Arduino, LED with all wires and resistors
Required Setup: OpenAI API key, Arduino IDE, Google Teachable model
